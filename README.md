# GaussianRandomFields

A Julia package to compute and sample from Gaussian random fields.

[some nice plots here]

## Key Features

* Generation of stationary (isotropic and anisotropic) and separable non-stationary covariance functions. 
* We provide most standard covariance functions such as Gaussian, Exponential and Mat&eacute;rn. Adding a custom covariance function is very easy.
* Implementation of most common methods to generate Gaussian random fields: Cholesky factorization, Karhunen-Lo&egrave;ve expansion, circulant embedding.
* Easy generation of Gaussian random fields defined on a Finite Element mesh.
* Versatile plotting features for easy visualisation of Gaussian random fields.
